# GEMINI Project Analysis

## Project Overview

This project, `practice4j`, is a multi-language software project built with Gradle. It includes source code in Java, Kotlin, and Scala, indicating a flexible and potentially experimental environment for practicing and comparing these languages. The project is set up with a standard directory structure, including `src/main` and `src/test` for each language.

The `build.gradle` file is configured to handle the compilation and testing of all three languages, with dependencies on the Kotlin and Scala standard libraries, as well as JUnit 5 for testing.

The `docs/tasks.md` file provides a detailed roadmap for the project's future development, covering areas such as project structure, testing, documentation, code quality, and CI/CD. This suggests that the project is intended to evolve into a more robust and well-structured application.

## Building and Running

### Building the Project

To build the project, you can use the following Gradle command:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

This will compile the source code, run the tests, and create a JAR file in the `build/libs` directory.

### Running the Application

The project is configured as a Java application, with the main class set to `Main`. To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
./gradlew run
```

### Running Tests

To run the tests for all languages, use the following command:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

## Development Conventions

Based on the project's configuration and documentation, the following development conventions can be inferred:

*   **Languages**: The project supports Java, Kotlin, and Scala. While the primary language is not explicitly defined, the `docs/tasks.md` file suggests a future decision to resolve duplication between Java and Kotlin implementations.
*   **Testing**: The project uses JUnit 5 for testing across all languages. The `tasks.md` file indicates a goal to implement comprehensive unit and integration tests, as well as code coverage reporting.
*   **Code Quality**: The `tasks.md` file outlines a plan to implement static code analysis tools, linting, and code formatting to ensure high code quality.
*   **Documentation**: The project aims to have comprehensive documentation, including JavaDoc/KDoc comments, architectural documentation, and user guides.
*   **CI/CD**: The `tasks.md` file includes a section on setting up a CI/CD pipeline with automated testing, code quality checks, and deployment.
